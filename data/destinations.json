The connection floods your synapses with information that feels less like intrusion and more like remembrance: differential equations describing consciousness itself, schematics for devices that translate memory into manipulable data streams, protocols for the systematic erasure and reconstruction of human identity. Through the cascade of returning knowledge, you glimpse yourself moving through sterile corridors, your lab coat a pristine white against the institutional grey. Your hands—these same hands—adjusting dials, calibrating equipment, while silent figures in cells dream their prescribed dreams. The machine's resonance matches your heartbeat with cruel precision, each pulse drawing you deeper into recognition. You begin to understand that perhaps you are not the subject of this experiment, but rather... But the thought fragments as the machine's hunger grows.
